# 🧠 Daily DSA Practice

Welcome to my **Daily DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)** repository!  
This repo is my personal space to track, organize, and commit solutions to coding problems I solve daily.

---

## 📌 About

This repository includes:

- ✅ Daily coding problems
- 💡 Optimized solutions in C++ 
- 📝 Notes, edge case handling, and time/space complexity
- 📚 Problems from platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, etc.

---


## 🚀 Goals

- 📆 Solve at least 1 DSA problem daily
- 🧠 Strengthen problem-solving skills
- 📈 Track growth over time
- 🔍 Revisit and refactor old solutions

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: C++ (primarily)
- **Editors**: VSCode / Jupyter
- **Platforms**: LeetCode, GFG, Codeforces, etc.
